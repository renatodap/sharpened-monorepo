## New Monorepo Structure
```
sharpened-monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── website/        # From sharpened-website
│   ├── feelsharper/    # From feelsharper
│   └── studysharper/   # From studysharper
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/            # Shared UI components
│   └── config/        # Shared configurations
└── [workspace configs]
```

## Migration Method
- File contents copied (without git history)
- Fresh git repository initialized
- Original repositories preserved with archive tags
- Dependencies managed via pnpm workspaces
- Build orchestration via Turborepo

## Backup Location
Full backup created at: `C:\Users\pradord\Documents\Projects\_backup_20240813-*`

## GitHub Migration Steps
1. Create new repository: `sharpened` or `sharpened-monorepo`
2. Push this monorepo to the new repository
3. Archive the original repositories on GitHub
4. Update any CI/CD pipelines
5. Update deployment configurations

## Notes
- Git history was not preserved in the monorepo for simplicity
- Original repositories remain intact for historical reference
- All environment variables need to be copied from original `.env.local` files
