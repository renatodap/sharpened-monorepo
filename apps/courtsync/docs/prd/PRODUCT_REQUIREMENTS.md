# CourtSync - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product**: CourtSync - NCAA Division III Tennis Team Management App  
**Target Market**: NCAA Division III tennis programs (starting with Rose Hulman Institute of Technology)  
**Budget**: $10/month per team operating cost  
**Timeline**: 2-week MVP development sprint  
**Platform**: Mobile-first PWA with desktop support  

CourtSync addresses critical pain points in college tennis team management: court scheduling conflicts, scattered communication, manual travel planning, and lack of video analysis tools. Built on the Sharpened brand system, it provides a unified platform for coaches and players to coordinate all team activities efficiently.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points at Rose Hulman Tennis
1. **Court Scheduling Chaos**: Limited facilities (6 outdoor + 6 indoor courts) with no centralized booking system
2. **Communication Fragmentation**: WhatsApp threads, emails, and verbal communication create information silos
3. **Manual Travel Coordination**: Paper itineraries and phone calls for away matches
4. **No Video Analysis**: 6 iPads available but no system to organize/share recordings
5. **Lost Institutional Knowledge**: Opponent scouting notes disappear when coaches/players graduate
6. **Academic Conflicts**: No integration with class schedules causing missed practices

### Market Validation
- **NCAA Division III**: 450+ institutions with tennis programs
- **Team Size**: 10-16 players per team (men's and women's)
- **Current Solutions**: Generic team apps (TeamSnap) lack tennis-specific features
- **Budget Reality**: Most D3 programs have <$500/year for technology
