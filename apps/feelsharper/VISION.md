# vision

act as a team of the best product engineer, best business developer, best fitness coach, best nutritionist, best sports coaches of all types of sports, highly experienced UI/UX designers, and multiple highly experienced senior software engineers and considering adding more valuable professionals and experts into your team
the main thing to ask is: "what is it that blocks people from achieving their goals in fitness, sports, and overall well being?" seriously. think deeply about those problems. and then think deeply about the solutions to those problems. and how people using this platform could be helped to solve those issues. it has to actually drive results in people. meals, tests, workouts, timing, weighing, metrics. what is it that people miss? the right reason to follow the journey? appreciating the day-today battle? identify ALL the possible problems. act like you are consulting a large variety of people with different goals and identify all possible roadblocks when it comes to health, fitness and wellbeing in their lives.
the second most important thing to ask is: "how are people gonna feel when they enter this platform?"
it has to be clean and easy to use. people have to WANT to use the platform. but more importantly, they have to want to achieve their results. they have to want to be disciplined when using the platform. it has to be simple. easy to use. but also highly customizable in the sense that the degree of expertise in fitness/wellbeing for each person makes the platform adjust to them. they have to feel motivated. the have to be able to track progress.
third most important: "what are the features that this webapp/mobile app can provide?
calendar, workout tracking, weight tracking, running pace/results, reps and weights for each gym excerise, macros and calorie tracking, supplements etc. there are sooo many more features. think integrating my fitness pal with apple health/garmin with strava, with runna with however many more apps could be relevant for inspiration. vo2 max. etc. think about ways users can provide input.
lastly, build the social aspect. strava is so effective because you get motivation from seeing others crushing it too.
let's make an impact in the world. i'm counting on you.

i opened the dashboard and it overwhelmed me. like there are way too many things. think of a clean way to show what matters.
also, the user should be able to choose which features they want (and which they dont) like weight, macros, workouts, run based on their goal
it has to feel like a fucking unified experience where the user knows exactly where to go. 
like they first get asked what their goals are. and they set their goals. then they select which features they want to see on their dashboard. and they can change that later. but its almost as if they know where to go. we could use the ai apis to do a lot of this too. 
it has to feel like they are talking to their coach, but they are not having to type too much, they just kinda select predefined options and maybe tweak them. the system should be able to analyze what the user is aking very specifically.
