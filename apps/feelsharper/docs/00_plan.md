## Implementation Strategy

### Autonomous Loop
```
For each feature:
1. Read requirements from FEATURES.md
2. Plan implementation in docs/features/
3. Implement with tests
4. Update documentation
5. Deploy to staging
6. Verify functionality
7. Update TRACKER.md
8. Commit with conventional message
```

### Quality Gates
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ ESLint/Prettier pass
- ✅ Unit tests green
- ✅ E2E tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Lighthouse score >90

### Documentation Automation
```javascript
// docs:expand script will:
1. Scan codebase for routes → API docs
2. Parse Supabase schema → ERD diagrams  
3. Extract features → test coverage map
4. Generate component storybook
5. Update main TOC
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers
1. **Supabase keys missing** → Use local Supabase
2. **Vercel deployment fails** → Fix iteratively
3. **Tests flaky** → Add retries, fix root cause
4. **Feature complex** → Break into smaller tasks
5. **API rate limits** → Add caching, throttling

### Contingencies
- If blocked >15 min → Document blocker, implement workaround
- If deployment fails → Use alternative (Netlify, Railway)
- If feature unclear → Implement MVP, iterate

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Production URL live and responsive
- [ ] All FEATURES.md items checked
- [ ] 0 TypeScript errors
- [ ] 0 ESLint errors
- [ ] >80% test coverage
- [ ] <3s page load time
- [ ] Perfect Lighthouse accessibility score
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

---

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Fix Vercel deployment (5 min)
2. Create health endpoints (5 min)
3. Set up Supabase project (10 min)
4. Begin feature implementation (continuous)
