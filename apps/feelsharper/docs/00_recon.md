## 1. Feel Sharper Analysis

### Current State
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with dark-first design
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Testing**: Jest configured, Playwright mentioned but not fully implemented
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows (currently problematic)
- **Deployment**: Attempting Vercel deployment

### Key Files & Structure
```

├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/          # React components
├── lib/                 # Utilities, types, database clients
├── scripts/             # Build and seed scripts
├── supabase/           # Migrations and config
├── __tests__/          # Test files
├── FEATURES.md         # Complete feature specification
├── BRAND_SYSTEM.md     # Design tokens and branding
└── CLAUDE.md           # AI agent instructions
```

### Current Issues
1. **Deployment blocked**: Build script requires OpenAI API key (embeddings generation)
2. **CI/CD failing**: Complex workflow with artifact dependencies failing
3. **Test coverage**: Tests exist but not comprehensive
4. **Documentation**: Minimal docs, no self-expanding system
5. **Environment setup**: .env.example exists but incomplete

### Database Schema (from migrations)
- `profiles` - User profiles with preferences
- `foods` - USDA food database (8000+ entries)
- `workouts` - Exercise tracking
- `body_weight` - Weight tracking
- `nutrition_logs` - Food diary entries
- RLS policies defined but not fully tested

## 2. Study Sharper Analysis

### Architecture Patterns to Port
- **Monorepo structure**: Uses pnpm workspaces
- **Package organization**: 
  - `apps/web` - Next.js frontend
  - `packages/core` - Shared types and utilities
  - `packages/ui` - Component library
- **Scripts**: Comprehensive automation scripts
- **Documentation**: Self-expanding docs system with TOC generation
- **Database**: Supabase with type generation from schema
- **Testing**: Full E2E setup with Playwright

### Key Scripts to Adapt
```json
{
  "db:types": "Generate TypeScript types from DB",
  "docs:toc": "Auto-generate documentation TOC",
  "ai:swap": "Swap AI providers",
  "db:seed": "Seed database with test data"
}
```

### Deployment Success Factors
1. **Separation of concerns**: Build doesn't require API keys
2. **Type safety**: Generated types from database
3. **Documentation**: Self-documenting with scripts
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage before deploy
5. **Environment**: Clear separation of dev/staging/prod

## 3. What to Port Immediately

### Priority 1 - Build & Deploy Fix
1. Remove OpenAI dependency from build
2. Simplify CI/CD to basic build-test-deploy
3. Add proper environment variable handling

### Priority 2 - Project Structure
1. Create `docs/` hierarchy with self-expanding system
2. Add `scripts/` for cross-platform automation
3. Implement type generation from Supabase

### Priority 3 - Testing & Quality
1. Set up Playwright properly
2. Add RLS policy tests
3. Create smoke test suite

### Priority 4 - Documentation System
```

├── architecture/       # System design docs

├── database/          # Schema and migrations

```

## 4. Blockers & Solutions

### Immediate Blockers
1. **OpenAI API requirement**: Already fixed in package.json but old commit deploying
2. **Vercel deployment**: Needs fresh commit with proper build script
3. **Database not provisioned**: Need to create Supabase project

### Solutions
1. Push new deployment with fixed build
2. Create Supabase project and run migrations
3. Set up proper environment variables in Vercel
4. Implement health check endpoints

## 5. Assets from Study Sharper to Leverage

### Scripts to Copy/Adapt
- Database type generation
- Documentation TOC generator  
- Cross-platform verify scripts
- Seed data management

### Patterns to Implement
- Monorepo structure (if beneficial)
- Package-based architecture
- Self-expanding documentation
- Comprehensive test harness

### CI/CD Approach
- Simple, reliable GitHub Actions
- No complex artifact dependencies
- Clear staging → production flow

## Next Steps (Autonomous Execution)
1. Generate comprehensive plan (00_plan.md)
2. Fix deployment immediately
3. Set up documentation system
4. Implement all FEATURES.md items
5. Create verification suite
