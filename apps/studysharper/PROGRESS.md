# Development Progress Log

## 2025-08-13 13:00 UTC - Session Start: Max Feature Burn Autonomy Mode

### Critical Path Analysis - Timestamp: 13:00 UTC

**Current State Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Auth system (Google OAuth + email) - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Database schema with comprehensive academic model - COMPLETE  
- ‚úÖ RLS policies with proper tenant isolation - COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Basic UI components (shadcn/ui, dark mode) - COMPLETE
- ‚ùå Academic structure UI/CRUD - MISSING (highest priority)
- ‚ùå Content ingestion pipeline - MISSING (blocks AI features)
- ‚ùå RAG/AI capabilities - MISSING (core differentiator)

**Critical Path Queue (Highest Value + Lowest Dependencies):**

1. **PRIORITY 1: Academic Structure Complete** 
   - Value: HIGH (unblocks all content organization)
   - Dependencies: LOW (only needs existing auth/db)
   - Components: School/Term/Course/Subject CRUD UI
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours implementation
   - Blocks: Content ingestion, study planning, everything else

2. **PRIORITY 2: PDF Upload & Processing Pipeline**
   - Value: HIGH (enables core content features) 
   - Dependencies: MEDIUM (needs academic structure)
   - Components: File upload, text extraction, chunking
   - Estimated: 3-4 hours implementation
   - Blocks: RAG, embeddings, AI tutor

3. **PRIORITY 3: RAG Pipeline Foundation**
   - Value: HIGH (core AI differentiator)
   - Dependencies: MEDIUM (needs content pipeline)
   - Components: Embeddings, vector search, Q&A API
   - Estimated: 4-5 hours implementation
   - Blocks: AI tutor, study recommendations

**Rationale:** Academic structure is the foundation that everything else builds on. Without it, users can't organize content, create study plans, or use any core features. It's also the simplest to implement with lowest external dependencies.

### High Priority Queue (Next 3 Features After Critical Path)
4. **Study Plan Generation** - AI-powered weekly scheduling
5. **Spaced Repetition Cards** - Auto-generated flashcards with SM-2
6. **AI Tutor Chat** - Conversational Q&A grounded in user content
