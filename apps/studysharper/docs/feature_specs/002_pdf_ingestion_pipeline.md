## Technical Features

### Upload System
- **File Validation**: PDF type checking, 50MB size limit
- **Storage Integration**: Supabase Storage with organized file paths
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with XMLHttpRequest
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user feedback

### Processing Pipeline
- **Job Queue System**: Sequential processing jobs (extraction → chunking → embedding)
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time progress updates per job type
- **Error Recovery**: Retry failed jobs, cancel processing
- **Completion Callbacks**: Automatic UI updates on completion

### Security & Performance
- **Row Level Security**: Complete data isolation between users
- **File Path Security**: User-scoped storage organization
- **Validation**: Server-side file type and size validation
- **Indexes**: Optimized database queries and vector search preparation

## User Experience

### Upload Flow
1. **Subject Selection** - Optional association with academic subjects
2. **File Upload** - Drag & drop or file picker with validation
3. **Progress Monitoring** - Real-time upload and processing status
4. **Completion Feedback** - Success confirmation with chunk count

### Content Management
- **Library Overview** - All uploaded content with status indicators
- **Processing Status** - Detailed progress for ongoing operations
- **Content Organization** - Subject-based organization
- **File Operations** - Delete, retry processing, view details

## API Specification

### Upload Response Format
```typescript
{
  success: boolean
  source_id?: string
  file_path?: string
  message?: string
  error?: string
}
```

### Status Response Format  
```typescript
{
  success: boolean
  status: {
    source_id: string
    overall_status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
    overall_progress: number (0-100)
    current_job?: ProcessingJob
    jobs: ProcessingJob[]
    chunk_count?: number
    estimated_completion?: string
  }
}
```
