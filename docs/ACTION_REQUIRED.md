## üö´ What NOT to Do

2. **Don't add features** - Focus on core experience
3. **Don't overthink pricing** - Start at $9.99
4. **Don't delay deployment** - Every day without users is wasted

## üí¨ Questions? Blocked?

**If Vercel deploy fails**: Check build logs, I'll fix code issues
**If no API keys**: Use my keys temporarily (not ideal but works)
**If domain unavailable**: Use Vercel subdomain for now
**If no users engage**: We'll try different channels

**REMEMBER**: A live product with 10 users beats perfect code with 0 users. Ship today!
