## ðŸŽ¯ HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS

### Framework:
1. **What would happen in 10 days if we chose wrong?**
   - Reversible = decide fast
   - Irreversible = think more

2. **What would aggressive founder do?**
   - Usually the scarier option
   - Usually the right option

3. **What creates most user value?**
   - Users > everything else
   - Revenue > vanity metrics

### When Stuck:
- **Default to action** over analysis
- **Default to simple** over complex  
- **Default to fast** over perfect
- **Default to cheap** over expensive
