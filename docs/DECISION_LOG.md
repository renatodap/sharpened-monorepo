# Decision Log

## 2025-01-14 08:15 - Sprint Initialization
- **Decision**: Created comprehensive git hook protection for apps/feelsharper
- **Rationale**: Strict requirement to not touch FeelSharper codebase
- **Impact**: All commits will be automatically validated
- **Alternative**: Could have used CI/CD only, but pre-commit is faster feedback

## 2025-01-14 08:16 - Product Selection Strategy
- **Decision**: Will build Reading Tracker and Study Sharper as the two new MVPs
- **Rationale**: Both have minimal external dependencies, quick path to value, and can reuse existing UI patterns
- **Impact**: Can deliver working MVPs within 4-hour sprint
- **Alternative**: Finance Organizer considered but requires more complex data modeling

## 2025-01-14 09:30 - Study Sharper Architecture
- **Decision**: Use Prisma + SQLite for local-first focus tracking data
- **Rationale**: Privacy-compliant, fast local queries, no external dependencies
- **Impact**: Zero server costs, user data ownership, GDPR-friendly
- **Alternative**: Could use browser localStorage but limited query capabilities

## 2025-01-14 10:15 - Focus Tracking Implementation
- **Decision**: Passive tracking using tab visibility + activity detection
- **Rationale**: Non-intrusive, respects privacy, works across different study activities
- **Impact**: User can track focus without manual start/stop
- **Alternative**: Manual session tracking considered but adds friction

## 2025-01-14 11:00 - Reading Tracker Data Model
- **Decision**: Comprehensive book metadata with session-based progress tracking
- **Rationale**: Supports both quick logging and detailed analytics
- **Impact**: Enables streak calculation, progress visualization, export functionality
- **Alternative**: Simpler page-count only model would miss session insights

## 2025-01-14 11:45 - Feature Flag Strategy
- **Decision**: Study Sharper focus tracking behind ENABLE_FOCUS_TRACKING flag (default: OFF)
- **Rationale**: Conservative rollout, explicit user consent, easy to disable
- **Impact**: Privacy-first approach, controlled beta testing
- **Alternative**: Always-on tracking would be simpler but less privacy-conscious

## 2025-01-14 12:00 - Music Coach Deferral
- **Decision**: Deprioritize Music Coach MVP to focus on quality of delivered products
- **Rationale**: Better to deliver 2 excellent MVPs than 3 mediocre ones
- **Impact**: Study Sharper and Reading Tracker are production-ready
- **Alternative**: Rush all 3 products would compromise quality and testing

## 2025-01-14 12:15 - Sprint Completion Strategy
- **Decision**: Focus remaining time on documentation, testing, and shipping preparation
- **Rationale**: Delivered products need proper docs and verification for handoff
- **Impact**: Products are immediately usable by team and beta users
- **Alternative**: Continue building features would leave incomplete deliverables

## 2025-08-14 19:42:13 - PROTECTION VERIFIED: Hook Successfully Blocked FeelSharper Changes
- **Incident**: Git attempted to commit apps/feelsharper/ files due to line ending changes
- **Action**: Pre-commit hook correctly blocked commit and logged incident
- **Resolution**: Unstaged protected files, proceeding with new product delivery only
- **Impact**: Demonstrates protection mechanism is working as designed
