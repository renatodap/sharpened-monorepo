# Sharpened Operating Principles

## Decision Making Framework

### Speed vs. Reversibility Matrix
| Decision Type | Reversible | Irreversible |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Low Impact** | Immediate execution | 1-day consideration |
| **High Impact** | 2-day consideration | Decision gate required |

### Decision Gates
Decisions requiring Owner approval are marked with üîê and tracked in `/docs/OWNER/DECISIONS_PENDING.md`

### Default to Action
- Bias toward shipping and learning
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Launch at 70% confidence, iterate to 100%
- Measure everything, adjust quickly

## Safety First

### User Data Protection
- **Principle**: User data is sacred
- **Practice**: 
  - Minimal collection (only what directly helps users)
  - Maximum security (encryption at rest and in transit)
  - Zero third-party sharing without explicit consent
  - 30-day default retention for non-essential data
  - GDPR-ready from day one

### Code Safety
- All changes through pull requests
- Automated testing before merge
- Feature flags for risky changes
- Rollback plan for every deployment
- No secrets in code, ever

### Financial Safety
- No spending without decision gate
- Track burn rate weekly
- 6-month runway minimum
- Revenue before expenses
- Default alive, not default dead

## User Respect

### Honest Communication
- Never promise what we can't deliver
- Acknowledge limitations openly
- Share methodology transparently
- Admit mistakes quickly
- Under-promise, over-deliver

### Time Respect
- Every feature must save user time
- No dark patterns or engagement tricks
- Clear, immediate value proposition
- Unsubscribe/delete in one click
- No unnecessary notifications

### Privacy by Design
- Opt-in for everything non-essential
- Clear data usage explanations
- User owns their data, always
- Export everything on request
- Delete completely on request

## Engineering Excellence

### Code Quality Standards
```
‚úÖ DO                           ‚ùå DON'T
- Type everything               - Use 'any' type
- Write tests first            - Ship without tests  
- Document complex logic       - Leave TODOs forever
- Refactor continuously        - Accumulate tech debt
- Review all code              - Merge without review
```

### Performance Targets
- Page load: < 2 seconds
- API response: < 200ms p50, < 1s p99
- Zero runtime errors in production
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Mobile-first, always

### Technical Decisions
- Boring technology for critical path
- Proven over trendy
- Monolith first, microservices when needed
- Buy (SaaS) for non-core, build for differentiators
- Open source when possible

## Growth Philosophy

- Response within 24 hours

### Feature Development
- User request ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Prototype ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Ship
- No feature without user validation
- Measure adoption for every feature
- Sunset unused features gracefully

1. **Technical**: Single points of failure
2. **Market**: Competitor with more resources
