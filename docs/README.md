## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Bias Toward Action
- When in doubt, do something
- Ship imperfect > perfect planning
- Users > features

### 2. Focus Ruthlessly  
- One main priority per day
- Finish before starting new tasks
- 1,000 users > everything else

### 3. Speed Wins
- Fast decisions > perfect decisions
- Quick iterations > long planning
- Market feedback > internal debate

---

**REMEMBER**: These docs exist to help you ship faster and reach 1,000 users. If they're not helping, ignore them and focus on users.

**CURRENT FOCUS**: Deploy FeelSharper today. Nothing else matters until it's live.
