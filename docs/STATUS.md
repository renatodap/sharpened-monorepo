6. **DG-006**: Analytics provider (PostHog recommended)
7. **DG-007**: Email service (Resend recommended)
8. **DG-008**: First hire timing and role

## Owner Actions Required üìã

### Immediate (Blocking Progress)
1. Add environment variables to Vercel/local
2. Review and approve pending decisions
3. Create service accounts (Vercel, Supabase, GitHub)

### This Week
4. Record product demo video
5. Review outreach templates
6. Set up Stripe account

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Product Focus: Feel Sharper Excellence
- [ ] Review current frictionless logging implementation
- [ ] Strengthen dashboards and weekly review
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Extract shared UI components
- [ ] Optimize website landing page

### Timeline
- Phase 2 Start: After owner reviews this report
- Phase 2 Duration: 2-3 days
- Phase 3-7: Additional 3-4 days

## Metrics

### Documentation Coverage
- Core docs: 100% complete
- Decision gates identified: 8
- Owner actions documented: 10

### Code Organization
- Shared packages created: 2 (config, ui)
- Apps configured: 3 (website, feelsharper, studysharper)
- Build system: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces

## Risks & Blockers

### Immediate Blockers
- Environment variables not configured (apps won't run)
- Pending decisions blocking pricing and legal work

### Upcoming Risks
- Feel Sharper needs UI/UX improvements for launch
- Website needs conversion optimization
- Test coverage is minimal

## Recommendation

**Priority 1**: Owner should:
1. Review `/docs/OWNER/DECISIONS_PENDING.md`
2. Add environment variables
3. Approve at least DG-001, DG-002, DG-004

**Priority 2**: Continue with Phase 2 (Product improvements) once unblocked

**Priority 3**: Begin user acquisition experiments per Growth Plan
