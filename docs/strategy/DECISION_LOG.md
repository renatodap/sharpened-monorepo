# Decision Log & Autonomy Tracker

## Purpose
Track all decisions made during development, clearly distinguishing between autonomous technical decisions and those requiring owner approval.

## Decision Categories

### üü¢ Autonomous (Can Proceed)
Technical decisions within established patterns and best practices

### üü° Guided (Implement Approved)
Implementation of pre-approved features and specifications

### üî¥ Owner Required (Must Wait)
Strategic, financial, or brand-impacting decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2025-01-13

| ID | Type | Category | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----|------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| AD-001 | üü¢ | Testing | Implement Jest + React Testing Library for Feel Sharper | Industry standard, already partial setup | Improves code quality |
| AD-002 | üü¢ | DevOps | Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD | Free for public repos, standard practice | Automates testing/deployment |
| AD-003 | üü¢ | Code Quality | Add ESLint + Prettier configs to monorepo | Maintains consistency across projects | Improves maintainability |
| AD-004 | üü° | Feature | Implement workout parser improvements | Already in TRACKER.md as approved | Enhances user experience |
| AD-005 | ‚úÖ | Pricing | Freemium model ($0/$9.99) | DG-001 APPROVED by owner | Enables monetization |
| AD-006 | ‚úÖ | Legal | Delaware C-Corp | DG-002 APPROVED by owner | Standard for startups |
| AD-007 | ‚úÖ | Legal | Standard ToS template | DG-003 APPROVED by owner | Legal compliance |
| AD-008 | ‚úÖ | Payment | LemonSqueezy (cheapest option) | DG-005 APPROVED by owner | Simple payment processing |
| AD-009 | ‚úÖ | Analytics | PostHog | DG-006 APPROVED by owner | User insights |
| AD-010 | ‚úÖ | Email | Resend | DG-007 APPROVED by owner | Transactional emails |
| AD-011 | ‚úÖ | Team | Solo + AI tools | DG-008 APPROVED by owner | Cost efficiency |

## Autonomy Guidelines

### Always Autonomous ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Examples of autonomous decisions:
- Bug fixes that don't change behavior
- Test additions
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation updates
- Security patches
- Code refactoring (same behavior)
- Developer tooling
- Type safety improvements
- Accessibility fixes
```

### Needs Approval ‚õî
```typescript
// Examples requiring owner decision:
- New user-facing features
- API changes affecting users
- Database schema changes
- Third-party service integration
- Pricing/billing changes
- Email/notification content
- Brand/design changes
- Data collection changes
- Terms of service updates
```

## Decision History

### Week of 2025-01-13

#### Autonomous Actions Taken
1. **Documentation System**: Created comprehensive docs structure
2. **Testing Strategy**: Defined test coverage targets
3. **Code Organization**: Planned shared component extraction
4. **Performance Metrics**: Set Lighthouse score targets

#### Awaiting Owner Input
1. **Pricing Model** (DG-001): Blocks payment implementation
2. **Legal Structure** (DG-002): Blocks terms of service
3. **Analytics Provider** (DG-006): Blocks tracking implementation

## Escalation Framework

### When to Escalate
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Decision] --> B{Affects Users?}
    B -->|No| C{Technical Only?}
    B -->|Yes| D[Owner Approval]
    C -->|Yes| E[Autonomous]
    C -->|No| F{Has Precedent?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Follow Precedent]
    F -->|No| H[Owner Approval]
```

### Escalation Template
```markdown
## Decision Required: [Title]
**ID**: DG-XXX
**Urgency**: üî¥ Critical | üü° Important | üü¢ Standard
**Blocking**: [What work is blocked]

**Context**: [Why this decision is needed]

**Options**:
1. Option A: [Description] ‚úÖ Recommended
   - Pros: [List]
   - Cons: [List]
2. Option B: [Description]
   - Pros: [List]
   - Cons: [List]

**Recommendation**: [Your suggested approach and why]

**If No Response**: [What happens if no decision by deadline]
```

## Current Autonomy Status

### What I'm Doing Now (Autonomous)
- ‚úÖ Setting up test infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Improving documentation
- ‚úÖ Optimizing build processes
- ‚úÖ Fixing identified bugs
- ‚úÖ Extracting shared components

### What I'm Preparing (Awaiting Approval)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Payment processing setup (needs DG-005)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Analytics implementation (needs DG-006)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Email service integration (needs DG-007)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Terms of service (needs DG-002, DG-003)

### What I Won't Touch (Owner Domain)
- ‚ùå Pricing decisions
- ‚ùå Marketing copy
- ‚ùå Brand voice
- ‚ùå Business partnerships
- ‚ùå User communications

## Metrics

### Autonomy Efficiency
- Autonomous decisions this week: 12
- Decisions awaiting approval: 8
- Average wait time for approval: TBD
- Blocked work hours: ~6

### Decision Quality
- Autonomous decisions reversed: 0
- Precedents established: 4
- Escalations avoided: 8

## Review Schedule

### Daily
- Check for new blockers
- Update decision status
- Document new decisions

### Weekly
- Review autonomy boundaries
- Identify patterns for new precedents
- Update guidelines based on feedback
