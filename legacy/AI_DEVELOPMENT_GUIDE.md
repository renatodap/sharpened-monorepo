- Store in workouts table
- Show parsed results for confirmation
- Add error handling for ambiguous input"
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```
GOOD: "Fix the login bug"

BETTER: "Users report login fails with 'undefined token' error. Debug the auth flow in apps/feelsharper/lib/auth, check token handling, and fix the issue. Add proper error messages."
```

### 3. Content Creation
```
GOOD: "Write blog posts about fitness"

BETTER: "Write 10 SEO-optimized blog posts (1500+ words each) targeting these keywords:
- 'ai fitness tracker'
- 'natural language workout log'
- 'myfitnesspal alternative 2025'
Include code examples, screenshots placeholders, and CTAs for FeelSharper"
```

### 4. Performance Optimization
```
"Analyze apps/feelsharper for performance issues:
- Check bundle size and implement code splitting
- Optimize images and add lazy loading
- Improve Core Web Vitals scores
- Add caching strategies
- Reduce API calls"
```

### 5. Testing & Quality
```
"Write comprehensive tests for workout parsing:
- Unit tests for parser functions
