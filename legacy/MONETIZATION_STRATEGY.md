# Sharpened Monetization Strategy
*From $0 to $100M ARR: Every dollar matters*

## Current Reality Check
- **Revenue**: $0
- **Costs**: ~$500/month (when launched)
- **Runway**: Bootstrapped

## The Bottom Line

Every feature you build should either:

2. **Activate** free users to paid
3. **Retain** existing customers
4. **Expand** revenue per customer
5. **Refer** new customers

If it doesn't drive revenue, don't build it.

Revenue solves all problems. No revenue, no business.
