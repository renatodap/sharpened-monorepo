## How to Run Locally

```bash

git checkout sprint/studysharper-focus-leaderboard-2025-08-14

# 2. Install dependencies (if needed)
cd apps/studysharper/apps/web
npm install

# 3. Start StudySharper dev server
npm run dev
# OR from root:
npm run dev:study

# 4. Open browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
# Go to Dashboard to see new features

# 5. Enable features (they're off by default)
# In browser console:
localStorage.setItem('focusTrackingEnabled', 'true')
localStorage.setItem('leagueSystemEnabled', 'true')
# Refresh page
```

## Demo Script

1. **Open StudySharper Dashboard**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - You'll see two new widgets: Focus Tracker and League

2. **Test Focus Tracking**
   - Click "Start" button on Focus Tracker
   - Move mouse/type to stay active
   - Watch the timer increment
   - Click privacy mode (eye icon) to hide stats
   - Click download icon for CSV export

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript installing** - Run `cd apps/studysharper/apps/web && npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. **Mock data fallback** when Supabase not configured (this is intentional for demo)
3. **Feature flags** require manual localStorage setup (by design for opt-in)

## Next 3 Moves

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Configure environment variables
   - Run database migrations
   - Enable feature flags in production

2. **Mobile PWA Optimization**
   - Add service worker for offline
   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Test on real devices

3. **User Feedback Integration**
   - Add feedback widget
   - Set up error tracking
   - Create user onboarding flow

## Metrics Snapshot

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript ready (requires npm install)
- ✅ ESLint configured
- ✅ Feature flags implemented (opt-in by default)
- ✅ Privacy-first design (all tracking opt-in)

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse Performance: Target > 80
- Lighthouse Accessibility: Target > 90  
- Lighthouse Best Practices: Target > 90
- Lighthouse SEO: Target > 90
- Note: Run `npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000` after local setup
