## The Mindset

### Remember Why You Started
You're obsessed with learning. You believe anyone can teach themselves anything. You're building the tools you wish existed. This isn't just a business - it's a mission to help millions become their best selves.

### Your Superpower
You can ship faster than anyone because you have AI assistance. You can test more ideas, iterate quicker, and learn faster. Use this advantage ruthlessly.

### The Opportunity
AI is transforming everything. Most people are scared. You're building the bridge to help them thrive. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Don't waste it.

## One Year From Now (August 2026)

If you execute this plan:
- 100,000+ users
- $500K+ MRR
- 10+ employees
- Series A raised
- 5+ products launched

If you don't:
- You'll still be reading documents
- Someone else will build this
- You'll regret not trying

## START NOW

Stop reading. Start doing.

Open terminal. Type:
```bash
cd apps/feelsharper
npm run build
```

Your future users are waiting.
