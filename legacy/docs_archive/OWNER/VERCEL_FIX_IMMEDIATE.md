# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE VERCEL FIX - DO THIS NOW

## YOUR BUILD IS FAILING - HERE'S THE FIX

### In Vercel Project Settings â†’ Build & Development Settings:

**CHANGE THESE SETTINGS IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Install Command**: 
   ```
   npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install
   ```
   
2. **Build Command**:
   ```
   pnpm run build
   ```

3. **Root Directory**:
   ```
   apps/feelsharper
   ```

4. **Output Directory**:
   ```
   .next
   ```

### STEP BY STEP:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on "feelsharper" project
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Click "Build and Deployment"
5. Update the fields above EXACTLY as shown
6. Click "Save"
7. Go to "Deployments" tab
8. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
9. Select "Redeploy"

### WHY IT'S FAILING:

- npm doesn't understand "workspace:*" dependencies (that's pnpm-specific)
- We need to install pnpm first, then use it for everything
- The install command `npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install` fixes this

### VERIFY IT'S WORKING:

After redeploying, you should see in the build logs:
```
Installing pnpm...
Running pnpm install...
```

If you still see errors, make sure the Install Command is EXACTLY:
```
npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install
```

**This will fix your deployment immediately!**
