# Business Development Framework

## Executive Summary
This document serves as the autonomous development guide for Sharpened businesses. It outlines areas where development can proceed independently while respecting owner decision boundaries.

## Autonomous Development Zones

### 1. Technical Infrastructure (Full Autonomy)
Areas where I can make decisions and implement improvements independently:

#### Code Quality & Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Implement comprehensive test suites
- **Code Standards**: Enforce linting, formatting, type safety
- **Documentation**: Keep technical docs current
- **Performance**: Optimize build times, bundle sizes, runtime performance
- **Security**: Apply security best practices (no API keys in code, input validation)

#### Development Workflows
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions, build automation
- **Development Tools**: Scripts, utilities, developer experience
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking, performance monitoring setup
- **Dependency Management**: Keep packages updated, security patches

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Code Organization**: Refactor for maintainability
- **Shared Components**: Extract and standardize UI/utilities
- **API Design**: RESTful best practices, error handling
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes, query performance

### 2. Product Implementation (Guided Autonomy)
Areas where I implement based on existing specifications:

#### Feature Development
- **Approved Features**: Implement features from PRD/specs
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix identified issues without breaking changes
- **UI Polishing**: Improve existing UI within brand guidelines
- **A/B Test Setup**: Prepare experiments for approved tests

#### Content & Documentation
- **Technical Docs**: API docs, setup guides, architecture docs
- **Code Comments**: Inline documentation for complex logic
- **Migration Guides**: Database migrations, upgrade paths
- **Troubleshooting**: Known issues and solutions

### 3. Growth Engineering (Collaborative)
Areas where I prepare but don't execute without approval:

#### Analytics Setup
- **Event Tracking**: Implement approved analytics events
- **Conversion Funnels**: Set up tracking for defined funnels
- **Performance Metrics**: Page speed, Core Web Vitals
- **User Behavior**: Session recording setup (with consent)

#### SEO & Performance
- **Technical SEO**: Meta tags, structured data, sitemaps
- **Page Speed**: Lazy loading, code splitting, caching
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader support
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design, touch interactions

## Owner Decision Boundaries

### Strategic Decisions (Owner Only)
These require explicit owner approval:

1. **Business Model**
   - Pricing changes
   - Revenue models
   - Partnership decisions
   - Market positioning

2. **Product Direction**
   - New feature approval
   - Feature deprecation
   - User experience philosophy
   - Target audience changes

3. **Brand & Marketing**
   - Brand voice/tone
   - Visual identity changes
   - Marketing campaigns
   - Public communications

4. **Legal & Compliance**
   - Terms of Service
   - Privacy Policy
   - Data handling policies
   - Regulatory compliance

5. **Financial**
   - Vendor selection (>$100/month)
   - Infrastructure scaling
   - Hiring decisions
   - Investment/funding

## Development Workflow

### Daily Operations
```
1. Check OWNER/DECISIONS_PENDING.md for blockers
2. Review TodoWrite list for current tasks
3. Implement approved work autonomously
4. Document significant changes
5. Update status reports
```

### Weekly Cycles
```
Monday: Review metrics, plan week
Tuesday-Thursday: Deep implementation work
Friday: Documentation, testing, cleanup
```

### Communication Protocol
- **Blocking Issues**: Flag immediately in DECISIONS_PENDING.md
- **Progress Updates**: Update STATUS.md weekly
- **Technical Decisions**: Document in CHANGELOG.md
- **Questions**: Add to OWNER/DECISIONS_PENDING.md

## Current Development Priorities

### Phase 2: Product Excellence (Current)
1. ✅ Test coverage for Feel Sharper
2. ⬜ Performance optimization
3. ⬜ UI component standardization
4. ⬜ Mobile experience improvements

### Phase 3: Growth Foundation (Next)
1. ⬜ Analytics implementation
2. ⬜ SEO optimization
3. ⬜ Conversion funnel setup
4. ⬜ A/B testing framework

### Phase 4: Scale Preparation
1. ⬜ Monitoring & alerting
2. ⬜ Database optimization
3. ⬜ Caching strategy
4. ⬜ CDN setup

## Metrics & KPIs

### Technical Health
- Test Coverage: Target 80%
- Build Time: <2 minutes
- Lighthouse Score: >90
- Type Coverage: 100%

### Product Quality
- Bug Count: <5 critical
- Performance: <3s page load
- Accessibility: WCAG AA
- Mobile Score: >95

### Development Velocity
- Features/Week: Track trend

## Risk Management

### Autonomous Mitigation
I can handle these without escalation:
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Performance degradations
- Test failures
- Documentation gaps
- Code quality issues

### Escalation Required
Must involve owner for:
- Data breaches
- Service outages
- Legal concerns
- User complaints
- Financial impacts

## Documentation Updates

### Self-Expanding System
This documentation system self-updates based on:
1. Implemented features → Update feature docs
2. Resolved issues → Update troubleshooting
3. Performance improvements → Update metrics
4. New patterns → Update best practices

### Version Control
- All docs include last updated date
- Major changes tracked in CHANGELOG.md
- Decisions logged in DECISION_LOG.md
