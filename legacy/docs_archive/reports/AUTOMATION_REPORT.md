## Decisions Made Autonomously

1. **Jest + React Testing Library** for testing (industry standard)
2. **Sentry** for error tracking (open-source option available)
3. **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (free for public repos)
4. **Turborepo** build optimization (already configured)
5. **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality (community standard)
6. **Content Security Policy** implementation (security best practice)

## Blocked Items (Need Owner Decision)

| Item | Blocker | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| Payment Processing | DG-005 (Stripe vs Paddle) | Can't implement checkout |
| Analytics Platform | DG-006 (PostHog vs Plausible) | Can't track user behavior |
| Email Service | DG-007 (Resend vs SendGrid) | Can't send notifications |
| Pricing Model | DG-001 (Freemium vs Trial) | Can't implement billing |

## Next Autonomous Actions
