# Focus Tracking Disclosure

**Last Updated: January 14, 2025**

## What is Focus Tracking?

StudySharper includes an optional focus tracking feature that automatically measures how long you spend studying. No manual timers, no start/stop buttons - it just works.

## How It Works

### Detection Methods
1. **Tab Visibility**: We detect when the StudySharper tab is active
2. **User Activity**: We monitor for keyboard, mouse, and scroll activity
3. **Inactivity Timeout**: After 5 minutes of no activity, we pause tracking
4. **Page Navigation**: Tracking pauses when you leave, resumes when you return

### What We Track
- **Duration**: How long you're actively studying
- **Time Periods**: When you study (for patterns)
- **Session Count**: Number of study sessions
- **Nothing Else**: No screenshots, no keylogging, no content recording

### What We DON'T Track
- What you're studying
- Which websites you visit
- Your keystrokes or clicks
- Your camera or microphone
- Other applications on your device

## Privacy Features

### Opt-In by Default
- Focus tracking is OFF until you explicitly enable it
- You must click "Start Tracking" to begin
- Clear visual indicator when tracking is active

### Privacy Mode
- Hide your stats from view while still tracking
- Useful for shared computers or screenshots
- Toggle on/off anytime with one click

### Local-First Storage
- Data saved to your device first
- Only synced to server for leaderboards (if enabled)
- Works offline completely

## Data Control

### You Can:
- **Export** all your focus data as CSV anytime
- **Delete** all tracking history with one click
- **Pause** tracking without losing data
- **Disable** the feature completely

### We Promise:
- Never share your focus data with third parties

## League Competition

### How Leagues Use Your Data
- Only your total weekly minutes are shared
- Shown as points to other league members
- Your name/username is visible to your league (8 people max)
- You can use a pseudonym if preferred

### Opting Out of Leagues
- Use focus tracking without joining leagues
- Leave a league anytime
- Your historical data is never shared retroactively

## Technical Details

### Accuracy
- Generally accurate within 1-2 minutes per session
- May undercount if you read without interacting
- May overcount if you leave without closing tab
- Designed to be "good enough" not perfect

### Battery & Performance

- Efficient event-based detection
