Just launched Sharpened - AI coaching that actually works.

We trained 17 specialized AIs on expert knowledge from each domain:
â€¢ FeelSharper: Exercise science & biomechanics
â€¢ StudySharper: Cognitive psychology & learning science
â€¢ WealthSharper: CFP curriculum & behavioral finance
â€¢ And 14 more coming...

The difference? These aren't chatbots giving generic advice. They're domain experts that create personalized, measurable plans.

Two products are live now (PWA - no app store needed):
â†’ feelsharper.vercel.app
â†’ studysharper.vercel.app

Early access: $4.99/month for all 17 coaches (normally $9.99)

We built this because we were tired of:
- Generic AI giving surface-level advice
- Fitness apps that don't understand periodization
- Study tools that ignore spaced repetition science
- Finance apps that miss behavioral psychology

If you want AI that knows what actually works in each domain, check it out.

1/ Launched Sharpened today - 17 specialized AI coaches, each an expert in their domain

Not another ChatGPT wrapper. We trained each AI on actual expertise:
- Exercise science
- Learning psychology  
- Music theory
- Behavioral finance
And more

2/ The problem with generic AI:

Ask ChatGPT for a workout plan â†’ generic template
Ask FeelSharper â†’ periodized program with progressive overload, deload weeks, and form cues

The difference? Domain expertise.

3/ Two coaches are live now:

FeelSharper (Fitness): feelsharper.vercel.app
StudySharper (Learning): studysharper.vercel.app

Both are PWAs - work instantly on any device, no app store needed.

4/ StudySharper just shipped:
- Passive focus tracking (zero input required)
- Weekly micro-leagues (compete with 7 others)
- Automatic CSV export

Track study time without lifting a finger.

5/ Why we built this:

Tired of AI that sounds smart but lacks depth.
Wanted coaches that actually understand the science.
Needed measurable progress, not feel-good metrics.

6/ Early access deal:

First 1000 users: $4.99/month forever
(Will be $9.99 after launch)

Includes all 17 coaches as they launch.

7/ What's next:

### First Comment
```
Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

Maker here. We built Sharpened because we were frustrated with generic AI giving surface-level advice.

Each of our AI coaches is trained on real expertise:
- FeelSharper: Exercise science papers, biomechanics research
- StudySharper: Cognitive psychology, learning science studies
- WealthSharper: CFP curriculum, behavioral economics

The difference is huge. Ask a generic AI for a workout and you get "do 3 sets of 10." Ask FeelSharper and you get periodized programming with RPE targets, form cues, and deload protocols.

For Product Hunt users: Use code "PH50" for 50% off your first 3 months.
